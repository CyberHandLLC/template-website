## üåé **Location-Specific Pages**

- Location data displayed prominently in page title: _"AC Repair in Orrville, OH"_
- Custom content sections that reference the specific location:
  - Service area map highlighting the specific city/region
  - Local testimonials from customers in that area
  - Mentions of local landmarks or neighborhoods when appropriate
- "Nearby Services" section showing other locations we serve

### 2. **Location Detection System**

- Location persistence across sessions (saved in browser storage)

### üì± **Mobile UX Tips (Short Page Flow)**
- Each section limited to **1 screen height**
- Avoid large image banners or long FAQ sections
- Use **carousels and collapsible components** (like service cards and testimonials) to reduce scroll fatigue
- Bottom sticky bar (optional): Call | Message | Schedule
- Location reminder in sticky footer on location pages

## üîÑ **Technical Implementation Notes**

### Location Detection Priority
1. Browser geolocation API (requires user permission)
2. Vercel IP-based geolocation headers
3. Default location fallback ("Northeast Ohio")

### Common Location Issues & Solutions
- **Homepage vs. Service Pages Discrepancy**: Ensure middleware consistently handles all routes. Special attention to homepage ('/') which often requires different handling than dynamic routes.
- **Middleware Configuration**: Use a consistent matcher pattern that includes both static and dynamic routes.
- **Header Handling**: Normalize header access across all components to prevent issues with case sensitivity.

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load location-specific content
- Cache location data in localStorage
- Prerender popular location pages
- Implement route prefetching for commonly visited location combinations

### SEO Strategy for Location Pages
- Unique metadata for each service+location combination
- Structured data markup (LocalBusiness schema)
- Location sitemaps for Google
- Canonical URL structure to avoid duplicate content issues
- Location-specific keywords in page titles, URLs, and headings
